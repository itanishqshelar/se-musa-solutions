**Project Scheduling**

**Definition**:
Project scheduling is the process of assigning resources, tasks, timelines, and dependencies to the various activities in a project. It involves defining the sequence of tasks, estimating the duration of each task, allocating resources, and setting deadlines to ensure that a project is completed on time and within budget.

**Key Components of Project Scheduling**:

- **Activity Definition**: Identifying all the tasks and activities needed to complete the project.
- **Task Dependencies**: Determining the sequence of activities and their interdependencies (e.g., which tasks must be completed before others can begin).
- **Resource Allocation**: Assigning people, equipment, and other resources to specific tasks.
- **Duration Estimation**: Estimating how much time each activity will take.
- **Setting Milestones**: Establishing key points or deadlines during the project timeline.
- **Setting a Timeline**: Organizing tasks on a timeline while accounting for task dependencies.

**Common Tools for Project Scheduling**:

- **Gantt Charts**: Visual representation of a project schedule.
- **Critical Path Method (CPM)**: Identifies the sequence of tasks that determine the shortest timeline to complete a project.
- **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**: Used for projects with uncertain activity durations.
- **Resource Leveling**: Ensures optimal use of resources across all project activities.

**Tracking Technique: Critical Path Method (CPM)**

**Definition**:
The Critical Path Method (CPM) is a scheduling technique used to determine the longest sequence of dependent tasks in a project. This sequence is known as the critical path, and it establishes the minimum time needed to complete a project.

**How CPM Works**:
The CPM identifies the sequence of tasks that must be completed in a specific order and calculates their durations to determine the overall project timeline. Any delay in the critical path activities will directly lead to a delay in the entire project.

**Steps to Apply CPM**:

- List all activities required for the project.
- Determine the sequence of tasks and their dependencies.
- Estimate the duration of each activity.
- Identify the critical path (the longest sequence of dependent tasks).
- Determine slack time (the flexibility for tasks that are not on the critical path).
- Monitor progress to ensure that critical path activities are completed on time.
