# ⭐ **1. Types of Software Prototypes**

Software prototyping means creating an **early, simplified version** of the software to understand requirements and get feedback.

Below are the major types:

---

## **1️⃣ Throwaway / Rapid Prototype**

- Built quickly to understand unclear requirements.
- Used only for learning and feedback.
- **Discarded afterwards**—not part of final system.

**Use when:** Requirements are unclear or user is unsure.

---

## **2️⃣ Evolutionary Prototype**

- Developed step-by-step and **refined continuously** based on feedback.
- Becomes part of the **final system**.

**Use when:** Requirements continuously evolve.

---

## **3️⃣ Incremental Prototype**

- System is built as **multiple small prototypes** (modules).
- Each prototype is built, tested, and improved.
- Later integrated to make the final system.

**Use when:** System can be divided into modules.

---

## **4️⃣ Extreme Prototype (Used in Web Apps)**

- Done in **three phases:**

  1. Create static UI prototype
  2. Make UI interactive
  3. Connect to backend

- Common in web/mobile app development.

---

## **5️⃣ Operational Prototype**

- Fully functional prototype used in real environment.
- Later expanded or replaced.

---

## **6️⃣ Concept Prototype**

- Demonstrates the **core idea or concept**.
- Used to evaluate feasibility.

# 📌 **Short Exam Table**

| Prototype Type | Used For                   | Included in Final Product? |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Throwaway      | Clarifying requirements    | ❌ No                      |
| Evolutionary   | Gradually improving system | ✔ Yes                      |
| Incremental    | Building module by module  | ✔ Yes                      |
| Extreme        | Web apps (UI-heavy)        | ✔ Yes                      |
| Operational    | Real-world testing         | ✔ Yes                      |
| Concept        | Check feasibility          | ❌ No                      |

# ⭐ **2. Prototype Model (Detailed Explanation)**

The **Prototype Model** is an SDLC model where a **working model of the software** is built early to understand requirements, especially when requirements are **unclear or incomplete**.

---

# 🔹 **Definition (Exam-Ready)**

**The Prototype Model is a software development model in which a prototype (temporary working model) is built, tested, and refined based on user feedback until the exact requirements are understood.**

---

# 🔹 **Phases of Prototype Model**

### **1. Requirements Gathering**

- Only basic & incomplete requirements are collected.
- Focus on unclear and ambiguous parts.

---

### **2. Quick Design**

- A rough design is prepared.
- Concentrates on important screens, input/output, main functions.

---

### **3. Build Prototype**

- A simple, working prototype is created.
- May include simple UI, limited functionality.

---

### **4. User Evaluation**

- Users interact with the prototype.
- Give feedback on missing features, improvements, changes.

---

### **5. Refinement**

- Based on feedback:
  ✓ Fix issues
  ✓ Add new features
  ✓ Improve design
- Prototype is updated and shown again.

---

### **6. Final System Development**

- Once requirements are clear, **actual system** is developed using suitable SDLC model.

---

### **7. Testing and Maintenance**

- Final product is tested and then maintained.

# ⭐ Flow of Prototype Model (Simple Diagram)

```
Requirements → Quick Design → Build Prototype → User Evaluation
       ↑                                                ↓
       ←——————— Refinement/Modification ————————
```

---

# 🔹 **Advantages**

✔ Good for unclear requirements
✔ Reduces misunderstandings between user & developer
✔ Early user feedback
✔ Helps detect missing or wrong requirements
✔ Better user satisfaction
✔ Faster development of final system

---

# 🔹 **Disadvantages**

✘ Time-consuming if too many changes
✘ Users may think prototype = final product
✘ Poorly designed prototype can mislead the project
✘ Cost may increase if refinement cycles are too many

---

# 🔹 **When to Use Prototype Model?**

✔ Requirements not clear
✔ High user interaction is needed
✔ New technology involved
✔ User interface–heavy applications

**Examples:**

- Mobile apps
- E-commerce websites
- Banking software
- Online reservation systems

---

# 🎯 **Exam-Ready Summary**

**A prototype is an early working model used to understand unclear requirements. There are several types such as throwaway, evolutionary, incremental, and extreme prototypes. The Prototype Model builds a quick prototype, gets user feedback, refines it multiple times, and then develops the final system based on verified requirements.**
