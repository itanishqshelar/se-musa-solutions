**Agile software engineering** embraces a philosophy that encourages customer satisfaction, incremental software delivery, small project teams (composed of software engineers and stakeholders), informal methods, and minimal software engineering work products.

- **Agile software engineering guidelines**: Stress on-time delivery of an operational software increment over analysis and design.
- **Agile software engineering**: Combines a philosophy and a set of deployment guidelines.
- **The philosophy**: Encourages customer satisfaction and early incremental delivery of software: small, highly motivated project teams; informal methods; minimal software engineering work products; and overall development simplicity.
- **The development guidelines**: Stress delivery over analysis communication between developers and customers.

**Who does It**:

- Software engineers and other project stakeholders (managers, customers, end users) work together on an agile team--- a team that is self-organizing and in control of its own destiny.
- An agile team fosters communication and collaboration among all who serve on it.

**Features**:

- An agile team is able to respond to changes during project development.
- Agile development recognizes that project plans must be flexible.
- Agility encourages team structures and attitudes that make communication among developers and customers more facile.
- Agility eliminates the separation between customers and developers.
- Agility emphasizes the importance of rapid delivery of operational software and deemphasizes importance of intermediate work products.
- Agility can be applied to any software process as long as the project team is allowed to streamline tasks and conduct planning in way that eliminate non-essential work products.

**Agile Process**:

- **AGILE methodology**: Is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project.
- Both development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the Waterfall model.

**The Agile Process is based on Three Components**:

1.  It is difficult to predict in advance which software requirements will persist and which will change. It is equally difficult to predict how customer priorities will change as a project proceeds.
2.  For many types of software design and construction are interleaved. That is both activities should be performed in tandem so that design models’ construction is used to prove the design.
3.  Analysis, design, and testing are not as predictable from a planning perspective as one might like them to be.

**Agility Principles**:

- The highest priority is to satisfy customers through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements even late in development, accommodating change is viewed as increasing the customer’s competitive advantage.
- Delivering working software frequently with a preference for shorter delivery schedules (e.g., every 2 or 3 weeks).
- Business people and developers must work together daily during the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they need, trust them to get the job done.
- Face-to-face communication is the most effective method of conveying information within.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes support sustainable development, developers and customers should be able to continue development indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity (defined as maximizing the work not done) is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and design emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals teams reflects how to become more effective and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

**Extreme programming (XP)**: Is one of the most important software development frameworks of Agile models. It is used to improve software quality and responsiveness to customer requirements. The extreme programming model recommends taking the best practices that have worked well in the past in program development projects to extreme levels. Good practices need to be practiced in extreme programming: Some of the good practices that have been recognized in the extreme programming model and suggested to maximize their use are given below:

- **Code Review**: Code review detects and corrects errors efficiently. It suggests pair programming as coding and reviewing of written code carried out by a pair of programmers who switch their works between them every hour.
- **Testing**: Testing code helps to remove errors and improves its reliability. XP suggests test-driven development (TDD) to continually write and execute test cases. In the TDD approach test cases are written even before any code is written.
- **Incremental development**: Incremental development is very good because customer feedback is gained and based on this development team comes up with new increments every few days after each iteration.
- **Simplicity**: Simplicity makes it easier to develop good quality code as well as to test and debug it.
- **Design**: Good quality design is important to develop good quality software. So, everybody should design daily.
- **Integration testing**: It helps to identify bugs at the interfaces of different functionalities. Extreme programming suggests that the developers should achieve continuous integration by building and performing integration testing several times a day.

**Basic principles of Extreme programming**:

- **XP**: Is based on the frequent iteration through which the developers implement User Stories.
- **User stories**: Are simple and informal statements of the customer about the functionalities needed. A User Story is a conventional description by the user of a feature of the required system. It does not mention finer details such as the different scenarios that can occur.
- Based on User stories, the project team proposes **Metaphors**. Metaphors are a common vision of how the system would work. The development team may decide to build a **Spike** for some features.
- A **Spike**: Is a very simple program that is constructed to explore the suitability of a solution being proposed. It can be considered similar to a prototype.

Some of the basic activities that are followed during software development by using the XP model are given below:

- **Coding**: The concept of coding which is used in the XP model is slightly different from traditional coding. Here, the coding activity includes drawing diagrams (modeling) that will be transformed into code, scripting a web based system, and choosing among several alternative solutions.
- **Testing**: XP model gives high importance to testing and considers it to be the primary factor to develop fault free software.
- **Listening**: The developers need to carefully listen to the customers if they have to develop good quality software. Sometimes programmers may not have the depth knowledge of the system to be developed. So, the programmers should understand properly the functionality of the system and they have to listen to the customers.
- **Designing**: Without a proper design, a system implementation becomes too complex and very difficult to understand the solution, thus making maintenance expensive. A good design results elimination of complex dependencies within a system. So, effective use of suitable design is emphasized.
- **Feedback**: One of the most important aspects of the XP model is to gain feedback to understand the exact customer needs. Frequent contact with the customer makes the development effective.
- **Simplicity**: The main principle of the XP model is to develop a simple system that will work efficiently in the present time, rather than trying to build something that would take time and may never be used. It focuses on
  some specific features that are immediately needed, rather than engaging time and effort on speculations of
  future requirements.
  Applications of Extreme Programming (XP):
  Some of the projects that are suitable to develop using the XP model are given below:
  Small projects: XP model is very useful in small projects consisting of small teams as the face-to-face meeting
  is easier to achieve.
  Projects involving new technology or Research projects: This type of project face changing requirements
  rapidly and technical problems. So XP model is used to complete this type of project.
