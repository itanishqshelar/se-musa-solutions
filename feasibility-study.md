A **Feasibility Study** is the initial and most important phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
Its purpose is to determine **whether the proposed system is practical, achievable, and worth developing**.
It evaluates different factors—technical, economic, operational, legal, and others—to decide if the project should proceed.

A feasibility study answers the question:
👉 _“Should we build this system? And if yes, how?”_

# ✅ **Objectives of Feasibility Study**

1. Understand the problem and project scope
2. Determine if the solution is **workable** with given resources
3. Estimate **cost, benefits, and risks**
4. Decide whether to continue, modify, or cancel the project
5. Provide a foundation for project planning and budgeting

# ⭐ **Types of Feasibility Studies**

Below are the major types, explained in detail.

---

# **1. Technical Feasibility**

This determines whether the technically required resources exist to develop the system.

### **It checks:**

- Availability of hardware and software
- Technical expertise (skills of programmers, designers)
- Compatibility with existing systems
- Modern technologies required (cloud, databases, networking)

### **Example:**

Is it possible to build a real-time payment system with current server capacity?

**Outcome:**
Confirms whether the organization has (or can acquire) the technology to implement the project.

---

# **2. Economic Feasibility (Cost–Benefit Analysis)**

It examines whether the project is **financially viable**.

### **It includes:**

- Development cost
- Hardware/software cost
- Training cost
- Maintenance cost
- Expected savings
- Expected revenue

### **Types of Costs & Benefits:**

- **Tangible Benefits:** Reduced operating cost, increased profit
- **Intangible Benefits:** Better customer satisfaction, brand value

**Outcome:**
Decides if benefits outweigh the costs.

---

# **3. Operational Feasibility**

This checks whether the proposed system will **work smoothly in the organization**.

### **It evaluates:**

- User acceptance
- Change in work environment
- Staff capability
- Organizational culture
- Whether the new system solves the existing problems

### **Example:**

Will staff be able to operate the new system without difficulty?

**Outcome:**
Ensures users will support and use the system properly.

---

# **4. Legal Feasibility**

Determines whether the project complies with all **laws, regulations, and standards**.

### **It checks:**

- IT laws (Data privacy, security compliance)
- Licensing agreements
- Copyright / Intellectual property issues
- Government rules and industry standards

### **Example:**

A system handling customer data must comply with data protection laws.

---

# **5. Schedule Feasibility**

Determines whether the project can be completed within the **given time frame**.

### **It includes:**

- Project deadlines
- Availability of resources
- Complexity of tasks
- Time for training and deployment

### **Example:**

Can the project be completed before a competitor releases a similar product?

**Outcome:**
Checks if the timeline is realistic.

---

# **6. Social Feasibility (Human & Social Impact)**

Evaluates the **impact of the system on people** inside and outside the organization.

### **It considers:**

- Acceptance by employees
- Impact on job roles
- Resistance to change
- Public acceptance (for government systems)

---

# **7. Environmental Feasibility (Optional but modern)**

Checks whether the project might affect the **physical environment**.

### **Includes:**

- Energy consumption
- Equipment disposal
- Carbon footprint
- Environmental regulations

---

# ⭐ **Conclusion**

A feasibility study is essential because it prevents **waste of time, cost, and effort** by identifying whether the project is realistic before development begins.
It ensures that the organization selects projects that are **achievable, economically justified, technically sound, legally compliant, and acceptable to users**.
